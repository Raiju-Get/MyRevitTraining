The Execute command has 3 parameters

1. External data object from the revit API which contains a reference to the revit application and view, required by the external command, we can therefore access the Revit data through this object
2. Takes a reference to a string object : Reference string returned if a command fails/cancels
3. It takes an element set object from the revit API, Which is Initially empty and can be used to display the elements , back to the user, If the command fails and the elements have been added to the element set in the command, these will be highlighted back to the user.

## Classifying Elements

When working with a Revit Model , The user tends to build everything with different objects such as walls, furniture, floors and windows, all these elements in Revit derive from a base class in the Revit API known as the element Class.

Therefore an revit project is a collection of different elements.

In order to work with them and search through them properly, we need to know some of the different ways their categories can be classified .

4 of the different ways are by their category , family, symbol , and instance.

  

1. Categories: it describes the group of element types the element is associated with. For example all of the walls belong to the walls category and all the doors to the door category . Every built in category in Revit which is the default category will have an associated built-in category association , so the wall category can be retrieved by the built in category
2. Family: Element classes grouped by their use, parameters, and appearance. Elements can also be classified by the families they below to, Families are then element classes that are grouped together in different categories
	1. In Revit API there are two types of families
		1. System Family : Tends to be built in such as walls 
		2. Component Family : Created externally and brought into the project
3. Symbols: represents a family with specific settings, Referred to as family types in the user interface and derived from ElementTypes class in the Revit API
4. Instance: An instance of a particular family symbol

```csharp
 Reference pickObj = uiDoc.Selection.PickObject(Autodesk.Revit.UI.Selection.ObjectType.Element);

                ElementId eleId = pickObj.ElementId;

                Element ele = doc.GetElement(eleId);

                ElementId eTypeId = ele.GetTypeId();

                ElementType eType  = doc.GetElement(eTypeId) as ElementType;
```

## Answer from ChatGPT
You are correct that the `ElementId` could be obtained directly from the `pickObj` in this specific case. The code snippet you provided does indeed obtain the `ElementId` from `pickObj` in the first step: `ElementId eleId = pickObj.ElementId;`. 

However, it's important to note that the `ElementId` obtained from `pickObj` refers to the element that was directly picked by the user in the Revit UI. In some cases, this may be the desired element to work with.

However, it's possible that the selected element is actually a dependent element or part of a larger element assembly. In such cases, retrieving the element using `doc.GetElement(eleId)` ensures that the entire assembly or dependent elements are retrieved as a whole, providing a more comprehensive representation of the selected object.

So, while it is possible to use the `ElementId` directly from `pickObj` in some scenarios, fetching the element from the `doc` using `doc.GetElement(eleId)` ensures consistency and completeness when working with dependent elements or element assemblies.

## Answer from Bard

You are correct, we could have used the `Id` property of the `pickObj` reference instead of getting the `ElementId` again using the `doc.GetElement` method. However, there are a few reasons why the code might be written this way.

* The code might be written this way to be more explicit. By getting the `ElementId` twice, the code makes it clear that the `eleId` variable is storing the ID of the element that was picked.
* The code might be written this way to be more efficient. The `doc.GetElement` method can be slow, so getting the `ElementId` once and then using it multiple times can improve performance.
* The code might be written this way to be more flexible. If the code needs to be changed to get the ID of a different type of object, then the `doc.GetElement` method can be used to get the ID of the object, regardless of the type of object that was picked.

Ultimately, the reason why the code is written this way is up to the developer. There are valid reasons to write the code either way.

## Difference (GPT)
In Autodesk Revit, the terms Category, Family, Symbol, and Instance are important concepts that help organize and represent elements within a building model. Here's a brief explanation of each term:

1. Category:
   - In Revit, a Category represents a broad classification or grouping of elements based on their common characteristics or functionality. Categories are predefined and cover a wide range of elements, such as walls, floors, doors, windows, etc. Each element in Revit belongs to a specific category. Categories help in organizing and applying consistent behaviors to elements within the model.

2. Family:
   - A Family in Revit is a collection of related elements that share common properties, behaviors, and graphical representations. It serves as a template or definition for creating instances of those elements within a project. Families are created and defined in the Family Editor, where you can specify parameters, geometry, constraints, and other properties. For example, a door family can define the common properties and geometry of different types of doors.

3. Symbol:
   - In Revit, a Symbol is a specific representation or variation of a Family. Each Family can have multiple Symbols or Types associated with it. Symbols define specific variations of the Family with different parameter values, dimensions, and other characteristics. For example, a door Family can have symbols for different door sizes, materials, or swing directions. Symbols provide flexibility in representing and placing different instances of a Family within a project.

4. Instance:
   - An Instance refers to a specific occurrence or placement of a Symbol within a project. It represents an individual element within the building model. Instances are created by placing a specific Symbol from a Family into the project environment. Each instance can have its own unique property values, dimensions, and other instance-specific information. For example, you can place multiple instances of a door Family with different sizes and properties throughout the building model.

To summarize, Categories provide a high-level classification of elements, Families define the common properties and behaviors for related elements, Symbols represent specific variations of Families, and Instances represent individual occurrences of Symbols within a project. This hierarchical structure helps in organizing, creating, and managing elements within the Revit building model.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Category|Family|Symbol|Instance|
|A collection of elements|A collection of elements with the same graphical representation and behavior|A specific instance of a family|A specific occurrence of a symbol in the Revit model|
|Used to organize elements in the Revit project browser and to control how elements are displayed in views|Stored in RFA files and can be loaded into Revit projects|Used to represent families in the Revit project browser and in views|Used to create the physical elements of the building model|


In a Revit project, there is a hierarchy consisting of elements, families, types, and instances. Here's a summary of each level:

1. Elements: These are specific objects located in the project, such as doors, windows, walls, floors, etc. Each element belongs to a particular category or classification.

2. Families: Families group similar elements together. For example, within the door element category, there can be different families like single flush doors or double doors. Families help organize and classify related elements.

3. Types: Types represent different variations or configurations within a family. For instance, within the door family, there can be different types based on dimensions or other specifications. Each type represents a distinct variation of an element.

4. Instances: Instances refer to specific occurrences of a type within the project. When you place an object in the model, you create an instance of a particular type. Instances have unique identities and represent individual occurrences of a specific element in the project.

Families in Revit are components used to build the BIM (Building Information Modeling) project. They have properties called parameters and graphical representations. There are three main classes of families in Revit:

1. System Families: These are predefined families like walls, roofs, ceilings, and floors. System families cannot be modified outside of the project.

2. Loadable Families: These families are created as external RFA (Revit Family) files. Examples include doors, windows, tables, etc. Loadable families can be updated or modified outside the project and then imported into the project.

3. In-Place Families: These are unique components created specifically for a particular project. They are created within the project itself and are not meant to be reused in other projects. In-place families are useful for designing one-off or project-specific elements quickly, without the need for parametric adjustments.

Creating families in Revit depends on the type of family. System families are already available in the project, loadable families are designed externally and imported, and in-place families are created directly within the project.

For more information and tutorials on creating Revit families, you can refer to the provided link in the description.
## Code Explanation (GPT)
The provided code displays a TaskDialog in Autodesk Revit that shows information about the classification and properties of an element. Let's break it down step by step:

```csharp
TaskDialog.Show("Element Classification: ", eTypeId.ToString() + Environment.NewLine
                + "Category:" + ele.Category.Name + Environment.NewLine
                + "Instance:" + ele.Name + Environment.NewLine
                + "Symbol: " + eType.Name + Environment.NewLine
                + "Family: " + eType.FamilyName);
```

1. `TaskDialog.Show("Element Classification: ", ...);`
   - This line creates a TaskDialog with the title "Element Classification: ". The TaskDialog is a user interface element in Revit that allows for displaying messages, information, and options to the user.

2. `eTypeId.ToString() + Environment.NewLine`
   - The `eTypeId` is an `ElementId` representing the type of the selected element. Here, it is converted to a string using the `ToString()` method. The `Environment.NewLine` adds a newline character to create a line break in the dialog.

3. `"Category:" + ele.Category.Name + Environment.NewLine`
   - `ele.Category` refers to the Category of the selected element. `ele.Category.Name` retrieves the name of the Category. The code concatenates the string "Category:" with the name of the Category and adds a line break.

4. `"Instance:" + ele.Name + Environment.NewLine`
   - `ele.Name` retrieves the name of the selected element, representing the instance of a Symbol within the project. The code concatenates the string "Instance:" with the name of the element and adds a line break.

5. `"Symbol: " + eType.Name + Environment.NewLine`
   - `eType.Name` retrieves the name of the Symbol associated with the selected element's ElementType (`eType`). The code concatenates the string "Symbol: " with the name of the Symbol and adds a line break.

6. `"Family: " + eType.FamilyName`
   - `eType.FamilyName` retrieves the name of the Family associated with the selected element's ElementType (`eType`). The code concatenates the string "Family: " with the name of the Family.

The resulting TaskDialog will display the element's type, category, instance name, symbol name, and family name, each on a separate line. This information helps provide a comprehensive understanding of the selected element's classification and properties.

Certainly! Here are examples of `ele.Category.Name`, `ele.Name`, `eType.Name`, and `eType.FamilyName`, along with their explanations:

1. `ele.Category.Name`:
   - Example: "Walls"
   - Explanation: This expression retrieves the name of the category to which the selected element belongs. For example, if the selected element is a wall, `ele.Category.Name` would return "Walls". It provides information about the broad classification or grouping of the element within the Revit model.

2. `ele.Name`:
   - Example: "Exterior Wall 01"
   - Explanation: This expression retrieves the name of the selected element. For instance, if the selected element is a specific instance of an exterior wall, `ele.Name` would return "Exterior Wall 01". It provides a specific identifier or name assigned to the instance of the element within the project.

3. `eType.Name`:
   - Example: "Double-Pane Window"
   - Explanation: This expression retrieves the name of the element type associated with the selected element. For example, if the selected element is a specific instance of a window, `eType.Name` would return "Double-Pane Window". It represents the specific variation or configuration of the element within its family.

4. `eType.FamilyName`:
   - Example: "Curtain Wall Systems"
   - Explanation: This expression retrieves the name of the family associated with the element type. For example, if the selected element is a specific instance of a curtain wall system, `eType.FamilyName` would return "Curtain Wall Systems". It represents the higher-level grouping or classification of related elements within the Revit model.

By using these expressions, you can access and display specific information about the selected element's category, instance name, element type name, and the associated family name. This allows you to provide detailed information about the element's classification, variation, and relationships within the Revit project.

The difference between `eType.Name` and `eType.FamilyName` lies in the information they provide about the element type and its associated family:

1. `eType.Name`:
   - `eType.Name` retrieves the name of the specific element type associated with the selected element. It represents a specific variation or configuration of the element within its family. This name is typically unique within the family and helps differentiate between different variations of the same element.
   - Example: If the selected element is a specific instance of a window, `eType.Name` might return "Double-Pane Window" or "Casement Window." It provides specific information about the variation or type of the element within its family.

2. `eType.FamilyName`:
   - `eType.FamilyName` retrieves the name of the family associated with the element type. It represents the higher-level grouping or classification of related elements within the Revit model. Families in Revit are collections of related elements that share common properties, behaviors, and graphical representations.
   - Example: If the selected element is a specific instance of a window, `eType.FamilyName` might return "Windows" or "Curtain Wall Systems." It provides information about the broader category or classification of the element within the Revit model.

In summary, `eType.Name` focuses on the specific variation or type of the element within its family, while `eType.FamilyName` provides information about the higher-level grouping or classification of related elements within the Revit model. Both names are valuable in understanding the element's characteristics, but they provide different levels of detail and context.

## FilteredElementCollector

Using the REvit API we can Filter for elements in a Revit project, by creating a Filtered elementCollector and Applying different filters to it.

When it is created is it is used to filter through all the elements in a  project

It can be constructed in 3 Different ways

1. Entire Revit document
2. Search through specific elements
3. Searching a specific view


![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WKSxD6HvjOGz6oJ-siDgQDNvL-liAQtumL7fchlpuJSyYUmPJyhIvR3SHzSM1FG3qEWymIZ3Ln1t7333OmLxX3HKmr3xWxHRFUtbLVJY5DrWpX23g_RXm4yFTa66o91J8A26zzWByOaF5gw_p4C6Ow)

Once a filter element and collected all the elements in on of these specific ways , we then need to apply a filter to reduce the element set wer are searching, In fact when creating a filtered element collector, it requires at least one filter before we can start accessing the elements that passes through the collector to reduce the element set wer are searching, to fit a certian crietera depending on what the filter is

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SqgSobWLoDbVXzzOuk1a12ay1gvuwzgkGkT_nb9r0azfRGEqH_Zkk0gNh38RxWdMYNmKhKJumJmmepGEDHeHlmDXV2hW079DAtLncv677ZbnsMDfsPmehQvd0vxuH_TUmhCFFL6SZSDE3SwAtVgwHA)

  

There are 3 types of filters we can use:

1. Quick

## Code Example for Filtering

```csharp
 FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);

                ElementCategoryFilter filter = new ElementCategoryFilter(BuiltInCategory.OST_Windows);

                IList<Element> windows =   collector.WherePasses(filter).WhereElementIsNotElementType().ToElements();

                TaskDialog.Show("Number of Windows", string.Format("{0} windows counted", windows.Count));
```


## Explanation from filtering (GPT)

Let's break down the code step by step and explain each event that occurs:

1. `FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);`:
   - This line creates a new `FilteredElementCollector` object named `collector`.
   - The `FilteredElementCollector` class is used to retrieve elements from the Revit document (`doc`) based on specific filtering criteria.

2. `ElementCategoryFilter filter = new ElementCategoryFilter(BuiltInCategory.OST_Windows);`:
   - This line creates an `ElementCategoryFilter` object named `filter` and specifies that it will filter elements based on the category of "Windows".
   - The `BuiltInCategory.OST_Windows` represents the built-in category for windows in Revit.

3. `IList<Element> windows = collector.WherePasses(filter).WhereElementIsNotElementType().ToElements();`:
   - This line retrieves the elements from the Revit document that meet the specified filtering criteria and stores them in the `windows` list.
   - The `WherePasses(filter)` method filters the elements based on the `filter` criteria, which is the category filter for windows.
   - The `WhereElementIsNotElementType()` method further refines the filter to exclude element types, as we are interested in instances of windows.
   - The `ToElements()` method returns the filtered elements as a collection.

4. `TaskDialog.Show("Number of Windows", string.Format("{0} windows counted", windows.Count));`:
   - This line displays a `TaskDialog` with the title "Number of Windows" and a message indicating the count of windows found.
   - The `windows.Count` retrieves the number of elements in the `windows` list.
   - The `string.Format()` method is used to format the message by substituting the window count into the specified placeholder `{0}`.

In summary, the code creates a `FilteredElementCollector` to collect elements from the Revit document. It then applies a category filter for windows and further refines it to exclude element types. Finally, it displays a `TaskDialog` showing the count of windows found based on the filtering criteria.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Function|Event|
|new FilteredElementCollector(doc)|Creates a new FilteredElementCollector and passes the current document as the argument to the constructor.|
|new ElementCategoryFilter(BuiltInCategory.OST_Windows)|Creates a new ElementCategoryFilter and passes the BuiltInCategory.OST_Windows constant as the argument to the constructor.|
|collector.WherePasses(filter)|Applies the ElementCategoryFilter to the FilteredElementCollector.|
|collector.WhereElementIsNotElementType()|Filters out any elements that are element types.|
|collector.ToElements()|Converts the FilteredElementCollector to a list of elements.|
|TaskDialog.Show()|Displays a task dialog that shows the number of windows that were found.|


## Applying Filters

To apply a single filter , we used the method

WherePasses method:

- FilteredElemetnCollector.WherePasses(Filter)
With the filter as the input parameter

```csharp
 FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);
            //600 x 900mm
            IList<Element> symbols = collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol)).WhereElementIsElementType().ToElements();

            FamilySymbol symbol = null;

            foreach (Element element in symbols)
            {
                if (element.Name == "600 x 900mm")
                {
                    symbol = element as FamilySymbol;
                }
            }
```

Let's go through the code step by step and explain each sub-function:

1. `FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);`:
   - This line creates a new `FilteredElementCollector` object named `collector`.
   - The `FilteredElementCollector` class is used to retrieve elements from the Revit document (`doc`) based on specific filtering criteria.

2. `IList<Element> symbols = collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol)).WhereElementIsElementType().ToElements();`:
   - This line retrieves all the elements of type `FamilySymbol` from the Revit document and stores them in the `symbols` list.
   - The `collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol))` method filters the elements to only include those of type `FamilySymbol`.
   - The `WhereElementIsElementType()` method further filters the elements to exclude instances and keep only the element types.
   - The `ToElements()` method returns the filtered elements as a collection.

3. `FamilySymbol symbol = null;`:
   - This line declares a variable named `symbol` of type `FamilySymbol` and initializes it to `null`.

4. `foreach (Element element in symbols)`:
   - This line starts a `foreach` loop that iterates over each `Element` object in the `symbols` list.

5. `if (element.Name == "600 x 900mm")`:
   - This line checks if the name of the current `Element` (`element`) is equal to the string "600 x 900mm".

6. `symbol = element as FamilySymbol;`:
   - This line assigns the `element` object to the `symbol` variable, but only if the `element` is of type `FamilySymbol`.
   - The `as` keyword is used for type casting. If the `element` is not of type `FamilySymbol`, the `symbol` variable will remain `null`.

Let's summarize the purpose of the code:
- The code starts by creating a `FilteredElementCollector` to collect elements from the Revit document.
- It then filters the collected elements to only include `FamilySymbol` element types.
- It iterates over the filtered `FamilySymbol` elements and checks if their names match "600 x 900mm".
- If a matching element is found, it assigns it to the `symbol` variable of type `FamilySymbol`.

Overall, the code is searching for a specific `FamilySymbol` with the name "600 x 900mm" and assigning it to the `symbol` variable for further use.

## Transactions

- Any changes made to revit models needs to be encapsulated inside of an active transaction otherwise an exception will be thrown
- Creating Transaction by using the transaction class

  

### Transaction Class

Elements of A transaction class

- Start() : Starts a transaction
- Commit(): commits any changes in a transaction to the model
- Rollback(): Reverts any changes made to the models inside a transaction

  

Once a transaction is committed the changes made inside the transaction become a part of the model, it is important to note that only one transaction can be active at one time. 

It is important to enclose the transaction within a using or try - catch to ensure the transaction does not unintentionally stay active.

```csharp
 try
            {
                using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(doc, "Placing Family"))
                {
                    transaction.Start();

                  

                    TaskDialog tDwag = new TaskDialog("Place Family");

                    tDwag.MainContent = "Are you sure you wanna place a family?";
                    tDwag.CommonButtons = TaskDialogCommonButtons.Ok | TaskDialogCommonButtons.Cancel;

                    doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(new XYZ(0, 0, 0), symbol,
                        Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure.StructuralType.NonStructural);

                    if (tDwag.Show()== TaskDialogResult.Ok)
                    {
                        transaction.Commit();
                        TaskDialog.Show("The Item as been ", "Placed");
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        transaction.RollBack();
                        TaskDialog.Show("The Item as not been ", "Placed");
                    }

                }
                return Result.Succeeded;
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                message = e.Message;
                return Result.Failed;
            }
```

Let's go through the code step by step and explain each sub-function:

1. `using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(doc, "Placing Family"))`:
   - This line starts a new transaction named "Placing Family" using the `Transaction` class.
   - The `using` statement ensures that the transaction is properly disposed of after its scope is completed.

2. `transaction.Start();`:
   - This line starts the transaction, marking the beginning of a series of changes to the Revit document (`doc`).

3. `TaskDialog tDwag = new TaskDialog("Place Family");`:
   - This line creates a new `TaskDialog` object named `tDwag` with the title "Place Family".

4. `tDwag.MainContent = "Are you sure you wanna place a family?";`:
   - This line sets the main content of the `TaskDialog` to the message "Are you sure you wanna place a family?".

5. `tDwag.CommonButtons = TaskDialogCommonButtons.Ok | TaskDialogCommonButtons.Cancel;`:
   - This line sets the common buttons of the `TaskDialog` to include both the "Ok" and "Cancel" buttons.

6. `doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(new XYZ(0, 0, 0), symbol, Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure.StructuralType.NonStructural);`:
   - This line creates a new instance of a family using the `NewFamilyInstance` method of the `Create` class.
   - The `XYZ(0, 0, 0)` represents the location of the family instance, where (0, 0, 0) corresponds to the coordinates (X=0, Y=0, Z=0).
   - The `symbol` variable represents the `FamilySymbol` to be placed.
   - The `Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure.StructuralType.NonStructural` parameter specifies that the family instance is non-structural.

7. `if (tDwag.Show() == TaskDialogResult.Ok)`:
   - This line displays the `TaskDialog` and checks if the user clicked the "Ok" button.
   - The `Show()` method displays the `TaskDialog` and returns the result indicating which button was clicked.

8. `transaction.Commit();`:
   - This line commits the transaction, saving the changes made to the Revit document.

9. `TaskDialog.Show("The Item as been ", "Placed");`:
   - This line displays a `TaskDialog` with the title "The Item has been" and the message "Placed".

10. `transaction.RollBack();`:
    - This line rolls back the transaction, discarding the changes made to the Revit document.

11. `TaskDialog.Show("The Item has not been", "Placed");`:
    - This line displays a `TaskDialog` with the title "The Item has not been" and the message "Placed".

12. `catch (Exception e)`:
    - This line starts a catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.

In summary, the code encapsulates the process of placing a family instance in a transaction. It displays a `TaskDialog` asking for confirmation to place the family. If the user clicks "Ok", the transaction is committed, and a success message is shown. Otherwise, the transaction is rolled back, and a failure message is shown. Any exceptions encountered during the execution are caught and result in a failure message.

## LINQ

### LINQ

- Language Integrated Query 
- Allows us to query and filter data structures through the use of query operators
- Performed utilizing them from , where and select query operators

### LINQ Extensions

- Extension methods extends existing objects by adding methods available to them
- LINQ extension methods add query functionality to existing C# IEnumerable type objects
- Example - First(), Select(), Cast()
- We should use native filters more as they are faster than Linq extensions
### Lambda Expressions

- Anonymous function which can be written inline
- Example - Select(x=>x==2)

```csharp
 FamilySymbol symbol = collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol))
                .WhereElementIsElementType()
                .Cast<FamilySymbol>()
                .First(x => x.Name == "600 x 900mm");
```

Let's break down the code step by step and explain each sub-function:

1. `FamilySymbol symbol = collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol))`:
   - This line retrieves elements of type `FamilySymbol` from the `collector` using the `OfClass` method.
   - The `typeof(FamilySymbol)` specifies the type of elements to be collected.

2. `.WhereElementIsElementType()`:
   - This line filters the retrieved elements to only include element types using the `WhereElementIsElementType` method.
   - It excludes instances and keeps only the element types.

3. `.Cast<FamilySymbol>()`:
   - This line converts the filtered elements to `FamilySymbol` type using the `Cast<FamilySymbol>()` method.
   - It ensures that the elements in the collection are specifically of type `FamilySymbol`.

4. `.First(x => x.Name == "600 x 900mm")`:
   - This line selects the first element in the collection that matches the specified condition using the `First` method.
   - The condition `x.Name == "600 x 900mm"` checks if the name of the element is equal to "600 x 900mm".

Let's summarize the purpose of the code:
- The code retrieves a collection of elements of type `FamilySymbol` from the `collector`.
- It filters the elements to only include element types and converts them to `FamilySymbol` type.
- It then selects the first element in the collection that has the name "600 x 900mm" using the `First` method.
- The selected `FamilySymbol` is assigned to the `symbol` variable.

In summary, this code retrieves a specific `FamilySymbol` with the name "600 x 900mm" from a collection of `FamilySymbol` element types. It allows you to access and work with the specific `FamilySymbol` instance that matches the given criteria.

## Placing Walls using Curves

```csharp
  FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);

            Level level = collector.OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Levels)
                .WhereElementIsNotElementType()
                .Cast<Level>()
                .First(x => x.Name == "L1");

            XYZ p1 = new XYZ(-10,-10,0);
            XYZ p2 = new XYZ(10,-10,0);
            XYZ p3 = new XYZ(15,0,0);
            XYZ p4 = new XYZ(10,10,0);
            XYZ p5 = new XYZ(-10,10,0);

            List<Curve> curves = new List<Curve>();
            Line l1 = Line.CreateBound(p1,p2);
            Arc l2 = Arc.Create(p2,p4,p3);
            Line l3 = Line.CreateBound(p4,p5);
            Line l4 = Line.CreateBound(p5,p1);

            curves.Add(l1);
            curves.Add(l2);
            curves.Add(l3);
            curves.Add(l4);



            try
            {
                using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(doc ,"Place Walls using Lines"))
                {
                    transaction.Start();

                    foreach (var curve in curves)
                    {
                        Wall.Create(doc, curve, level.Id,false);
                    }

                    transaction.Commit();
                }

                return Result.Succeeded;
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                message = e.Message;
                return Result.Failed;
            }
        }
```

Let's break down the code step by step and explain each sub-function:

1. `FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);`:
   - This line creates a new `FilteredElementCollector` object named `collector`.
   - The `FilteredElementCollector` class is used to retrieve elements from the Revit document (`doc`) based on specific filtering criteria.

2. `Level level = collector.OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Levels).WhereElementIsNotElementType().Cast<Level>().First(x => x.Name == "L1");`:
   - This line retrieves the first `Level` element from the `collector` that matches the criteria.
   - The `OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Levels)` filters the elements to only include those in the "Levels" category.
   - The `WhereElementIsNotElementType()` further filters the elements to exclude element types.
   - The `Cast<Level>()` ensures that the elements in the collection are specifically of type `Level`.
   - The `First(x => x.Name == "L1")` selects the first `Level` element that has the name "L1" as its name property.

3. `XYZ p1 = new XYZ(-10,-10,0);`, `XYZ p2 = new XYZ(10,-10,0);`, and so on:
   - These lines define `XYZ` variables representing 3D points in the coordinate space.
   - Each point has its X, Y, and Z coordinates specified.

4. `List<Curve> curves = new List<Curve>();`:
   - This line creates a new `List<Curve>` object named `curves` to store the curves that will be created.

5. `Line l1 = Line.CreateBound(p1, p2);`, `Arc l2 = Arc.Create(p2, p4, p3);`, and so on:
   - These lines create various `Line` and `Arc` objects based on the specified points (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`) using the `CreateBound` or `Create` methods.

6. `curves.Add(l1);`, `curves.Add(l2);`, and so on:
   - These lines add the created curves (`Line` and `Arc`) to the `curves` list.

7. `using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(doc, "Place Walls using Lines"))`:
   - This line starts a new transaction named "Place Walls using Lines" using the `Transaction` class.
   - The `using` statement ensures that the transaction is properly disposed of after its scope is completed.

8. `transaction.Start();`:
   - This line starts the transaction, marking the beginning of a series of changes to the Revit document.

9. `foreach (var curve in curves)`:
   - This line starts a `foreach` loop that iterates over each curve in the `curves` list.

10. `Wall.Create(doc, curve, level.Id, false);`:
    - This line creates a new wall in the Revit document using the `Wall.Create` method.
    - The `doc` represents the Revit document.
    - The `curve` represents the curve (line or arc) on which the wall will be placed.
    - The `level.Id` represents the `Level` on which the wall will be placed.
    - The `false` parameter indicates that the wall is not a curtain wall.

11. `transaction.Commit();`:
    - This line commits the transaction, saving the changes made to the Revit document.

12. `catch (Exception e)`:
    - This line starts a catch block to

 handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code.

In summary, the code creates a list of curves (lines and arcs) and a level. It then starts a transaction, iterates over each curve in the list, and creates walls on the specified level using the curves. Finally, it commits the transaction. Any exceptions encountered during the execution are caught and result in a failure message.


The `WhereElementIsNotElementType()` and `WhereElementIsElementType()` methods are used to further filter the elements retrieved from the `FilteredElementCollector` based on their element type.

In the code snippet:

```csharp
Level level = collector.OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Levels)
                .WhereElementIsNotElementType()
                .Cast<Level>()
                .First(x => x.Name == "L1");
```

The `WhereElementIsNotElementType()` method is used after filtering elements based on the "Levels" category (`OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Levels)`) to exclude any element types. The purpose is to ensure that only specific instances of levels are retrieved, not the level element types. The `Cast<Level>()` method is then used to convert the filtered elements to `Level` objects, and the `First(x => x.Name == "L1")` method selects the first level with the name "L1" from the filtered collection.

In the code snippet:

```csharp
FamilySymbol symbol = collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol))
                .WhereElementIsElementType()
                .Cast<FamilySymbol>()
                .First(x => x.Name == "600 x 900mm");
```

The `WhereElementIsElementType()` method is used after filtering elements based on the type `FamilySymbol` (`OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol))`) to only include element types. It excludes any instance elements of `FamilySymbol` and ensures that only the element types are considered. The `Cast<FamilySymbol>()` method is then used to convert the filtered elements to `FamilySymbol` objects, and the `First(x => x.Name == "600 x 900mm")` method selects the first `FamilySymbol` with the name "600 x 900mm" from the filtered collection.

In both cases, these filtering methods are used to narrow down the elements to the specific element types of interest and exclude any other unrelated element types.

## Difference between `WhereElementIsNotElementType()` and  `WhereElementIsElementType()`

The `WhereElementIsNotElementType()` and `WhereElementIsElementType()` methods are used to filter elements based on their element type in Revit. Here's an explanation of their differences and when to use them:

1. `WhereElementIsNotElementType()`:
   - This method is used to filter elements that are instances of an element type.
   - It excludes element types and includes only specific instances of elements.
   - It is useful when you want to work with individual instances of elements, such as walls, doors, windows, etc., and exclude their element types from the selection.

2. `WhereElementIsElementType()`:
   - This method is used to filter element types.
   - It excludes specific instances of elements and includes only the element types.
   - It is useful when you want to work with element types themselves, such as family symbols, materials, view types, etc., and exclude individual instances of those element types from the selection.

To summarize, `WhereElementIsNotElementType()` is used when you want to work with instances of elements and exclude their element types, while `WhereElementIsElementType()` is used when you want to work with element types and exclude specific instances of those element types.

In some cases, you may need to perform different operations or access different properties depending on whether you are working with element types or instances. Therefore, using the appropriate filtering method allows you to narrow down the selection to the desired elements based on your specific requirements.

## PlaceElementLoop (HTGMHA)

```csharp
UIDocument uiDocument = commandData.Application.ActiveUIDocument;
            Document doc = uiDocument.Document;

            ElementId floorytypeId = Floor.GetDefaultFloorType(doc, true);

            FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);

            Level level = collector.OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Levels)
                .WhereElementIsNotElementType()
                .Cast<Level>()
                .First(x => x.Name == "L1");

            XYZ p1 = new XYZ(-10, -10, 0);
            XYZ p2 = new XYZ(10, -10, 0);
            XYZ p3 = new XYZ(15, 0, 0);
            XYZ p4 = new XYZ(10, 10, 0);
            XYZ p5 = new XYZ(-10, 10, 0);

            List<Curve> curves = new List<Curve>();

            Line l1 = Line.CreateBound(p1,p2);
            Arc l2 = Arc.Create(p2,p4,p3);
            Line l3 = Line.CreateBound(p4,p5);
            Line l4 = Line.CreateBound(p5,p1);

            curves.Add(l1);
            curves.Add(l2);
            curves.Add(l3);
            curves.Add(l4);

            CurveLoop curveLoop = CurveLoop.Create(curves);
            CurveLoop offsetCurveLoop = CurveLoop.CreateViaOffset(curveLoop, 0.300, new XYZ(0, 0, 1));

            IList<CurveLoop> loop = new List<CurveLoop>(){ offsetCurveLoop };

            try
            {
                using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction( doc , "Placing A floor"))
                {
                    transaction.Start();

                    Floor.Create(doc,loop, floorytypeId,level.Id);

                    transaction.Commit();
                }
                return Result.Succeeded;
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                message = e.Message;
                return Result.Failed;
            }
```


This code snippet demonstrates the creation of a floor in Autodesk Revit. Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. `UIDocument uiDocument = commandData.Application.ActiveUIDocument;`
   - Retrieves the active `UIDocument` from the `commandData`.

2. `Document doc = uiDocument.Document;`
   - Retrieves the `Document` from the `UIDocument`.

3. `ElementId floorytypeId = Floor.GetDefaultFloorType(doc, true);`
   - Retrieves the default floor type for the project (`doc`) using the `Floor.GetDefaultFloorType` method. The `true` parameter indicates that the method should create a new floor type if one does not exist.

4. `FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);`
   - Initializes a `FilteredElementCollector` to collect elements from the document.

```
5. `Level level = collector.OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Levels)
                .WhereElementIsNotElementType()
                .Cast<Level>()
                .First(x => x.Name == "L1");`
```
   - Retrieves the level named "L1" from the document by filtering the elements based on the category "Levels" and selecting the first element with the specified name. The `WhereElementIsNotElementType()` method is used to exclude level element types.

6. Defines a series of `XYZ` points (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`, `p5`) that represent the corner points of the floor boundary.

7. Creates a list of curves (`curves`) to define the floor boundary. The curves consist of two lines (`l1`, `l3`) and an arc (`l2`).

8. `CurveLoop curveLoop = CurveLoop.Create(curves);`
   - Creates a `CurveLoop` object from the list of curves, defining the outer boundary loop.

9. `CurveLoop offsetCurveLoop = CurveLoop.CreateViaOffset(curveLoop, 0.300, new XYZ(0, 0, 1));`
   - Creates an offset curve loop (`offsetCurveLoop`) by offsetting the original curve loop (`curveLoop`) by a specified distance (0.300) in the vertical direction (new XYZ(0, 0, 1)).

10. `IList<CurveLoop> loop = new List<CurveLoop>(){ offsetCurveLoop };`
    - Creates a list (`loop`) containing the offset curve loop, which will be used to define the floor shape.

11. The code then starts a transaction using `Transaction` and gives it a name.

12. `Floor.Create(doc,loop, floorytypeId,level.Id);`
    - Creates a floor element using the `Floor.Create` method. It takes the document (`doc`), the floor shape (`loop`), the floor type (`floorytypeId`), and the level (`level.Id`) as parameters.

13. The transaction is then committed using `transaction.Commit()`.

1. The code returns `Result.Succeeded` if the transaction and floor creation are successful. If any exceptions occur, it catches them, assigns the exception message to the `message` variable, and returns `Result.Failed`.

                    TaskDialog.Show("Parameter", string.Format("parameter storage type {0} and the value {1}",
                        eParameter.StorageType.ToString(),
                        eParameter.AsDouble()));
                    using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(doc, "Change Head height"))
                    {
                        transaction.Start();
                        eParameter.Set(10);
                        transaction.Commit();
                    }
                }

```
In this code, the purpose is to allow the user to select an element in the Revit project and retrieve and modify a specific parameter of that element. Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `Reference pickObj = uiDocument.Selection.PickObject(Autodesk.Revit.UI.Selection.ObjectType.Element);`
   - This line prompts the user to select an element in the Revit project. The `PickObject` method opens a selection interface, and the user can click on an element to select it. The selected element is stored in the `pickObj` variable as a reference.

2. `ElementId elementId = pickObj.ElementId;`
   - This line retrieves the ElementId of the selected element from the `pickObj` reference. The `ElementId` uniquely identifies the element in the Revit project.

3. `Element element = doc.GetElement(elementId);`
   - This line retrieves the actual Revit element from the `ElementId` using the `GetElement` method. The `element` variable now represents the selected element that was chosen by the user.

4. `if (pickObj != null)`
   - This condition checks if the `pickObj` reference is not null, ensuring that an element was indeed selected by the user.

5. `Parameter eParameter = element.get_Parameter(BuiltInParameter.INSTANCE_HEAD_HEIGHT_PARAM);`
   - This line retrieves a specific parameter of the selected element. The `get_Parameter` method is used to access a parameter by its built-in parameter name or by the parameter's GUID. In this case, it retrieves the parameter with the name `INSTANCE_HEAD_HEIGHT_PARAM`, which represents the instance head height parameter.

6. `TaskDialog.Show("Parameter", string.Format("parameter storage type {0} and the value {1}", eParameter.StorageType.ToString(), eParameter.AsDouble()));`
   - This line displays a dialog box showing the storage type and current value of the selected parameter. The `TaskDialog.Show` method is used to create a dialog box with a title and message. The `StorageType` property of the parameter indicates the data type of the parameter, and the `AsDouble` method retrieves the value of the parameter as a double.

7. `using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(doc, "Change Head height"))`
   - This line starts a new transaction with the specified name. Transactions are used to group changes to the Revit project and allow for undo/redo functionality.

8. `transaction.Start();`
   - This line starts the transaction. All the modifications made within the transaction will be grouped together and can be undone/redone as a single unit.

9. `eParameter.Set(10);`
   - This line sets the value of the selected parameter to 10. The `Set` method is used to assign a new value to the parameter.

10. `transaction.Commit();`
    - This line commits the transaction, applying the changes to the Revit project.

This code allows the user to select an element, retrieve a specific parameter of that element, display its current value, and change the parameter value to 10 within a transaction.

## Changing Location

- Different elements can be created using points or curves.
- Elements' locations can be edited by setting new location points or curves.
- The location of an element can be retrieved using its location property, which returns a location class.
- To set a new location point, the current location point is retrieved and a new XYZ coordinate is created based on it.
- The new location point is assigned to the location point property of the element.
- The changes are committed to the model using the commit method of the transaction object.
- The command allows the user to select an element and change its location point if it exists.
- The transaction should be started only if a location point is selected.
- Errors can occur if there are multiple commits or transactions not properly started.
- Changing the location is just one way to edit elements, and there are other editing methods to explore.

```csharp
LocationPoint location = ele.Location as LocationPoint;

                    if (location != null)
                    {
                        transaction.Start();
                        XYZ locationPoint = location.Point;
                        XYZ newLocation = new XYZ(locationPoint.X + 3, locationPoint.Y, locationPoint.Z);

                        location.Point = newLocation;


                        transaction.Commit();
                    }
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to change the location of an element in Revit using the Revit API in C#:

1. `LocationPoint location = ele.Location as LocationPoint;`: This line retrieves the location of the element `ele` and casts it as a `LocationPoint`. The `as` keyword is used for the cast, and it returns `null` if the element's location is not a `LocationPoint`.

2. `if (location != null)`: This condition checks if the element's location is a `LocationPoint`. If it is, the code proceeds to modify the location.

3. `transaction.Start();`: This line starts a new transaction. Transactions are used to group changes made to the Revit model.

4. `XYZ locationPoint = location.Point;`: This line retrieves the current location point of the element.

5. `XYZ newLocation = new XYZ(locationPoint.X + 3, locationPoint.Y, locationPoint.Z);`: Here, a new `XYZ` object is created to define the new location point. The new location is set by adding an offset of 3 units to the X coordinate while keeping the Y and Z coordinates unchanged.

6. `location.Point = newLocation;`: This line assigns the new location point to the `Point` property of the `LocationPoint` object, effectively changing the element's location.

7. `transaction.Commit();`: This line commits the changes made to the model by completing the transaction.

Note: The code assumes that a `Transaction` object named `transaction` has been created and that the element `ele` has been selected beforehand. The code also assumes that the necessary Revit API namespaces and references have been included.

## Revit Geometry

![[Pasted image 20230705124548.png]]
Here's the explanation in bullet points:

- The Revit API offers various geometry types, including XYZ objects, lines, and arcs.
- The geometric model of a Revit 3D element is represented by a geometry element object, which contains different geometry types that make up the element.
- Geometry types include solids, meshes, geometry instances, curves, points, and polylines, which can be further broken down into faces, edges, and nested geometry instances.
- A geometry instance represents a stored set of geometry, commonly used for family instances like doors, consisting of multiple geometric elements.
- To retrieve geometry from an element, the geometry element object needs to be retrieved from the element and traversed as a list.
- Retrieved geometry objects are instances of the base class "Geometry" in Revit, which can be cast to their appropriate types (e.g., face, mesh, or geometry instance).
- If a geometry instance is encountered, the "GetInstance" method from the geometry instance object is used to retrieve its associated geometry element, which is then looped through again.
- The geometry property of an element provides access to its geometry, and the options parameter allows customization of the output.
- The options object can be created using the option class constructor, and properties like "ComputeReferences" and "DetailView" can be set to control the output.
- Extracted geometry can be used for various purposes, such as computing locations in relation to other elements, defining new elements, and obtaining properties like areas and lengths.

```csharp
 Reference picReference =
                    uiDocument.Selection.PickObject(Autodesk.Revit.UI.Selection.ObjectType.Element);

                if (picReference != null)
                {
                    ElementId elementId = picReference.ElementId;
                    Element element = document.GetElement(elementId);

                    Options gOptions = new Options();
                    gOptions.DetailLevel = ViewDetailLevel.Fine;
                    GeometryElement gElement = element.get_Geometry(gOptions);

                    foreach (var gItem in gElement)
                    {
                        Solid gSolid = gItem as Solid;
                        int faces = 0;
                        double area = 0;
                        foreach (Face gFaces in gSolid.Faces)
                        {
                            area += gFaces.Area;
                            faces++;
                        }

                        double areMetric = UnitUtils.ConvertFromInternalUnits(area, UnitTypeId.SquareMeters);
                        TaskDialog.Show("Show Area", string.Format("The Element has {0} walls and the area is {1}", faces, areMetric));
                    }

                  
```
Here's a detailed explanation of the code with subfunctions:

1. `picReference` is a variable of type `Reference` that is initialized by using the `PickObject` method of the `Selection` property of the `uiDocument` object. This method allows the user to interactively select an element in the Revit UI. The `PickObject` method takes an argument of type `ObjectType`, specifying the type of object to be selected.

2. The code checks if `picReference` is not null, indicating that the user has selected an object.

3. Inside the if statement, `ElementId` is retrieved from the `picReference` object and stored in the `elementId` variable.

4. The `document.GetElement` method is called with `elementId` as the argument to retrieve the Revit element associated with the selected `ElementId`. The resulting element is stored in the `element` variable.

5. An `Options` object named `gOptions` is created. The `gOptions` object is used to specify the level of detail for the geometry output.

6. The `DetailLevel` property of the `gOptions` object is set to `ViewDetailLevel.Fine`. This sets the detail level of the geometry to be as fine as possible.

7. The `get_Geometry` method is called on the `element` object, passing `gOptions` as the argument. This method retrieves the geometry of the element based on the specified options. The resulting `GeometryElement` is stored in the `gElement` variable.

8. A `foreach` loop is used to iterate over each `gItem` (geometry object) in the `gElement`.

9. Inside the loop, the `gItem` is cast as a `Solid` object and stored in the `gSolid` variable.

10. Variables `faces` and `area` are initialized to 0. These variables will be used to count the number of faces and accumulate the total area.

11. Another `foreach` loop is used to iterate over each `gFaces` (face) in the `gSolid.Faces` collection ***Remember to Cast the reference as Face otherise, the area won't be shown**.

12. Inside the inner loop, the area of each `gFaces` is accessed using the `Area` property and added to the `area` variable. Additionally, the `faces` variable is incremented.

13. The `UnitUtils.ConvertFromInternalUnits` method is used to convert the accumulated `area` from the internal unit (square feet) to square meters. The converted value is stored in the `areMetric` variable.

14. A `TaskDialog` is displayed with the title "Show Area" and a formatted message string that includes the count of faces (`faces`) and the converted area in square meters (`areMetric`).

15. The `TaskDialog.Show` method is called within the loop, so it will display the message for each geometry object in the `gElement`.

Overall, the code allows the user to select an element, retrieves its geometry, iterates over the faces of the solid geometry, calculates the total area, converts the area to square meters, and displays the result using a `TaskDialog`.

## Finding Intersections
 ```csharp
  Reference picReference =
                    uiDocument.Selection.PickObject(Autodesk.Revit.UI.Selection.ObjectType.Element);

                if (picReference != null)
                {
                    ElementId elementId = picReference.ElementId;
                    Element element = document.GetElement(elementId);

                    Options gOPtions = new Options();
                    gOPtions.DetailLevel = ViewDetailLevel.Fine;
                    GeometryElement gElement = element.get_Geometry(gOPtions);

                    Solid gSolid = null;

                    foreach (GeometryObject gObj in gElement)
                    {
                        GeometryInstance gInstan = gObj as GeometryInstance;

                        if (gInstan != null)
                        {
                            GeometryElement geometryElement = gInstan.GetInstanceGeometry();

                            foreach (GeometryObject item in geometryElement)
                            {
                                gSolid = item as Solid;
                                
                            }
                        }
                    }

                    FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
                    ElementIntersectsSolidFilter filter = new ElementIntersectsSolidFilter(gSolid);

                    ICollection<ElementId> intersection = collector.OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Roofs).WherePasses(filter).ToElementIds();

                    TaskDialog.Show("Revit", intersection.Count + " family instances intersect with the selected element (" + element.Category.Name + " id:" + element.Id.ToString() + ")");
                    uiDocument.Selection.SetElementIds(intersection);
                   
                    uiDocument.ShowElements(intersection);
                    uiDocument.RefreshActiveView();

```

## Projecting Rays


```csharp
 UIDocument uiDocument = commandData.Application.ActiveUIDocument;
            Document document = uiDocument.Document;

            try
            {
                Reference pickObj = uiDocument.Selection.PickObject(ObjectType.Element);


                if (pickObj != null)
                {
                    ElementId elementId = pickObj.ElementId;
                    Element element = document.GetElement(elementId);

                    LocationPoint locoPoint = element.Location as LocationPoint;

                    XYZ p1 = locoPoint.Point;

                    XYZ rayZ = new XYZ(0,0,1);

                    ElementCategoryFilter filter = new ElementCategoryFilter(BuiltInCategory.OST_Roofs);
                    ReferenceIntersector RefInst = new ReferenceIntersector(filter,FindReferenceTarget.Face,(View3D)document.ActiveView);
                    ReferenceWithContext refCon = RefInst.FindNearest(p1, rayZ);
                    Reference reference = refCon.GetReference();
                    XYZ intPoint = reference.GlobalPoint;
                    double dist = p1.DistanceTo(intPoint);

                    TaskDialog.Show("The Distance", string.Format("{0} is the distance between the points", dist));

                }


```

Sure! Here's an explanation of the code snippet in bullet points, assuming no prior knowledge of programming:

- The code snippet begins by getting the current active UI document (`uiDocument`) and the corresponding `Document` object (`document`).
- The code is wrapped in a `try` block, indicating that it will attempt to execute the code inside and handle any potential errors that may occur.
- The code then proceeds to prompt the user to select an element in the Revit project. This element is stored in a variable called `pickObj`.
- If an element is successfully selected (`pickObj != null`), the code continues to execute.
- The element ID of the selected element is retrieved from `pickObj` and stored in the variable `elementId`.
- Using the `document` object, the actual Revit element associated with the element ID is retrieved and stored in the variable `element`.
- The location of the element is accessed and cast to a `LocationPoint` object, stored in the variable `locoPoint`.
- The `Point` property of `locoPoint` is accessed and stored in the variable `p1`. This represents a specific point in the Revit project.
- A new `XYZ` object named `rayZ` is created with the coordinates (0, 0, 1), representing a vector pointing in the positive z-axis direction.
- An `ElementCategoryFilter` is created, specifying that only elements of the "Roofs" category should be considered.
- A `ReferenceIntersector` object is created with the filter, a target type of "Face" (representing the underside of the roof), and the active 3D view of the document.
- The `FindNearest` method of the `ReferenceIntersector` is called, passing `p1` (the origin point) and `rayZ` (the direction vector) as arguments. The result is stored in the `ReferenceWithContext` object `refCon`.
- The `Reference` object is extracted from `refCon` using the `GetReference` method and stored in the variable `reference`.
- The `GlobalPoint` property of `reference` is accessed and stored in the variable `intPoint`. This represents the point of intersection between the ray and the selected element.
- The distance between `p1` and `intPoint` is calculated using the `DistanceTo` method and stored in the variable `dist`.
- Finally, a `TaskDialog` is displayed, showing the value of `dist` as the distance between the two points.

In summary, this code snippet allows the user to select an element in a Revit project, projects a ray from a specific point in the project, finds the nearest intersection with a roof element, calculates the distance between the starting point and the intersection point, and displays the distance in a dialog box.

## Views in Revit
![[Pasted image 20230708141308.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230708141326.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230708141345.png]]
- The Revit API offers various methods for displaying and annotating elements, such as creating views, tagging elements, and generating sheets.
- Views in the Revit API inherit from the View class and include View3D, ViewDrafting, ViewPlan, ViewSection, and ViewSheet.
- Different types of views serve specific purposes: 3D views for visualizing the model, drafting views for creating 2D details, plan views for horizontal sections, section views for vertical sections, and sheet views for organizing multiple views on a sheet.
- Views can be distinguished by their ViewType property, which returns an enumeration representing the type of view (e.g., FloorPlan, Elevation, Detail).
- Views can also be differentiated by their view family type, which refers to the family type used to create the view.
- The view family type can be retrieved using the `GetTypeId` method from the view object, providing the ID of the type used to create the view.

```csharp
 UIDocument uiDocument = commandData.Application.ActiveUIDocument;
            Document document = uiDocument.Document;


            ViewFamilyType familyType = new FilteredElementCollector(document).OfClass(typeof(ViewFamilyType))
                .Cast<ViewFamilyType>()
                .First(x => x.ViewFamily == ViewFamily.FloorPlan);


            FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);

            Level level = collector.OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Levels).WhereElementIsNotElementType()
                .Cast<Level>().
                First(x => x.Name == "L1");

            try
            {
                using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(document,"Making Plans"))
                {
                    transaction.Start();
                    ViewPlan vPlan = ViewPlan.Create(document,familyType.Id,level.Id);
                    vPlan.Name = "First View";
                    transaction.Commit();
                }


                return Result.Succeeded;
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                message = e.Message;
                return Result.Failed;
            }
```

1. The code snippet starts by retrieving the current active UI document (`uiDocument`) and the corresponding `Document` object (`document`).

2. It creates a new `FilteredElementCollector` to collect view family types from the document. It filters the elements to include only `ViewFamilyType` objects and selects the first one that belongs to the "FloorPlan" view family.

3. Another `FilteredElementCollector` is created to collect elements from the document.

4. It uses the collector to find a specific level (`Level`) by filtering elements of the "OST_Levels" category, excluding element types, and selecting the first one with the name "L1".

5. Inside a `try` block, a new transaction named "Making Plans" is started using the `Transaction` object.

6. Within the transaction, a new `ViewPlan` object named `vPlan` is created using the `ViewPlan.Create` method. It takes the document, the ID of the selected view family type (`familyType.Id`), and the ID of the selected level (`level.Id`).

7. The `Name` property of `vPlan` is set to "First View" to give the created view a name.

8. The transaction is committed to save the changes made within it.

9. If the code execution reaches this point without any exceptions, the method returns `Result.Succeeded`.

10. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, the error message is assigned to the `message` variable, and the method returns `Result.Failed`.

In summary, this code creates a new floor plan view in the Revit document. It retrieves the necessary information such as the active document, the desired view family type (in this case, floor plan), and the level on which the plan will be based. It then starts a transaction, creates the view using the specified family type and level, assigns a name to the view, and commits the transaction.

## View Filter

```csharp
UIDocument uiDocument = commandData.Application.ActiveUIDocument;
            Document document = uiDocument.Document;

           List<ElementId> catElementIds = new List<ElementId>();
           catElementIds.Add(new ElementId(BuiltInCategory.OST_Sections));

           ElementParameterFilter filter =
               new ElementParameterFilter(ParameterFilterRuleFactory.CreateContainsRule(new ElementId(BuiltInParameter.VIEW_NAME),"WIP",false));

            try
            {
                using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(document,"View Filters") )
                {
                    transaction.Start();

                    ParameterFilterElement filterElement = ParameterFilterElement.Create(document,"WIP Filter", catElementIds,filter);
                    document.ActiveView.AddFilter(filterElement.Id);
                    document.ActiveView.SetFilterVisibility(filterElement.Id,false);
                    transaction.Commit();

                }

                return Result.Succeeded;
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                message = e.Message;
                return Result.Failed;
            }
```

Certainly! Let's explain the code and filters in more detail:

1. The code begins by getting the active UI document (`uiDocument`) and the corresponding document (`document`) in Revit.

2. It creates an empty list called `catElementIds` to store the categories (types) of elements we want to filter.

3. In this case, we add the built-in category "OST_Sections" to the list. This means we want to filter elements that belong to the "Sections" category.

4. Next, we create an `ElementParameterFilter` named `filter`. This filter allows us to apply rules based on element parameters (properties).

5. Inside the `ElementParameterFilter` constructor, we use `ParameterFilterRuleFactory` to create a rule. The rule is called a "contains" rule, which checks if a specific parameter (in this case, the view name) contains a certain value (in this case, "WIP"). The `false` parameter indicates that the rule is case-insensitive, meaning it doesn't distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters.

6. Now, let's play a game! We start a transaction called "View Filters" to make sure our changes can be saved together.

7. Within the transaction, we create a `ParameterFilterElement` called `filterElement`. This element represents our filter and allows us to apply it to a view.

8. Using the `Create` method of `ParameterFilterElement`, we provide the document, a name for our filter ("WIP Filter"), the list of category IDs (`catElementIds`), and the filter rule we created earlier.

9. We add our filter element to the active view (`document.ActiveView`) using the `AddFilter` method. This means the view will apply the filter to the elements it displays.

10. We also set the visibility of the filtered elements to `false` using the `SetFilterVisibility` method. This means the filtered elements will be hidden in the view.

11. Finally, we complete the game by committing our changes within the transaction.

12. If everything goes well without any errors, the code returns `Result.Succeeded` to indicate success.

13. However, if an exception occurs during the transaction, the error message is stored in the `message` variable, and the code returns `Result.Failed` to indicate failure.

In summary, this code creates a filter called "WIP Filter" in Revit. It filters elements belonging to the "Sections" category based on their view names. If the view name contains the letters "WIP" (not case-sensitive), those elements will be hidden in the view. The code wraps these operations in a transaction to ensure consistent changes in the document.

## Tagging Elements

```csharp

UIDocument uiDocument = commandData.Application.ActiveUIDocument;
            Document document = uiDocument.Document;

            TagMode tagMode = TagMode.TM_ADDBY_CATEGORY;
            TagOrientation tagOrientation = TagOrientation.Horizontal;

            List<BuiltInCategory> categories = new List<BuiltInCategory>();
            categories.Add(BuiltInCategory.OST_Windows);
            categories.Add(BuiltInCategory.OST_Doors);

            ElementMulticategoryFilter filter = new ElementMulticategoryFilter(categories);



            IList<Element> tElements = new FilteredElementCollector(document, document.ActiveView.Id)
                .WherePasses(filter).WhereElementIsNotElementType().ToElements();

            try
            {
                using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction( document , "Tagging Windows and Doors"))
                {
                    transaction.Start();
                    foreach (var ele in tElements)
                    {
                        Reference reference = new Reference(ele);
                        LocationPoint loc = ele.Location as LocationPoint;
                        XYZ point = loc.Point;

                        IndependentTag tag = IndependentTag.Create(document,document.ActiveView.Id,reference,true,tagMode,tagOrientation,point);
                    }

                    transaction.Commit();
                }
                return Result.Succeeded;
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                message = e.Message;
                return Result.Failed;
            }
```

Certainly! Let's break down the code and explain it in more detail:

1. The code starts by getting the active UI document (`uiDocument`) and the corresponding document (`document`) in Revit.

2. It defines the tag mode as `TM_ADDBY_CATEGORY` and tag orientation as `Horizontal`. These settings determine how the tags will be placed on elements.

3. It creates an empty list called `categories` to store the built-in categories of elements we want to tag.

4. In this case, it adds the built-in categories "OST_Windows" and "OST_Doors" to the list. This means we want to tag elements that belong to these categories.

5. Next, it creates an `ElementMulticategoryFilter` named `filter`. This filter allows us to specify multiple categories to include for tagging.

6. Within the `ElementMulticategoryFilter` constructor, we pass the `categories` list, indicating that we want to filter elements belonging to these categories for tagging.

7. Now, let's play a tagging game! We start a transaction called "Tagging Windows and Doors" to ensure our changes can be saved together.

8. Within the transaction, we create a new `FilteredElementCollector` by passing the `document` and the ID of the active view (`document.ActiveView.Id`). This collector will collect elements only within the active view.

9. We apply the `filter` to the collector using the `WherePasses` method. This filters the elements based on the categories specified in the `filter`.

10. We further filter the elements to exclude element types using the `WhereElementIsNotElementType` method. This ensures that we only tag instances of elements, not the element types themselves.

11. The `ToElements` method is called on the collector to retrieve a list of elements (`tElements`) that passed the filters and are ready to be tagged.

12. Within the transaction, we iterate through each element (`ele`) in the `tElements` list.

13. For each element, we create a `Reference` using the element as the input. This reference will be used to locate and place the tag.

14. We retrieve the location point of the element (`ele.Location as LocationPoint`) and get its coordinates (`loc.Point`).

15. Using the `Create` method of `IndependentTag`, we create a new tag (`tag`) in the `document.ActiveView.Id` at the specified `point` location. The tag is associated with the referenced element, and the tag mode and orientation are set accordingly.

16. After tagging all the elements, we commit the changes within the transaction to save them in the document.

17. If everything goes well without any errors, the code returns `Result.Succeeded` to indicate success.

18. However, if an exception occurs during the transaction, the error message is stored in the `message` variable, and the code returns `Result.Failed` to indicate failure.

In summary, this code tags windows and doors in the active view in Revit. It filters elements based on their categories and creates independent tags for each element. The tags are placed at the location of each element, using the specified tag mode and orientation. The code wraps these operations in a transaction to ensure consistent changes in the document.

## Creating Sheets


```csharp
 UIDocument uiDocument = commandData.Application.ActiveUIDocument;
            Document document = uiDocument.Document;


            FamilySymbol fPlan = new FilteredElementCollector(document).OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_TitleBlocks)
                .WhereElementIsElementType().Cast<FamilySymbol>().First();

            try
            {
                using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(document, "Creating plans"))
                {
                    transaction.Start();

                    ViewSheet sheet = ViewSheet.Create(document, fPlan.Id);
                    sheet.Name = "First Sheet";
                    sheet.SheetNumber = "J101";

                    transaction.Commit();
                }
                return Result.Succeeded;
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                message = e.Message;
                return Result.Failed;
            }
```
Sure! Here's an explanation of the code snippet:

1. The code begins by getting the active UI document (`uiDocument`) and the corresponding document (`document`) in Revit.

2. It creates a new `FilteredElementCollector` by passing the `document` and applies filtering to collect elements of the "OST_TitleBlocks" category. This is done using the `OfCategory` method.

3. The code further applies filtering to exclude element instances and only collect element types using the `WhereElementIsElementType` method.

4. The `Cast<FamilySymbol>` method is used to cast the elements in the collector to `FamilySymbol` types.

5. Finally, the `First` method is used to retrieve the first `FamilySymbol` element from the filtered collection. This represents the family symbol for the title block used for creating plans.

6. Now, let's proceed with creating plans! We start a transaction called "Creating plans" to ensure our changes can be saved together.

7. Within the transaction, we use the `Create` method of `ViewSheet` to create a new sheet (`sheet`) in the `document`, using the `Id` of the `fPlan` (FamilySymbol) as the title block.

8. We set the name of the sheet to "First Sheet" using the `Name` property.

9. We also set the sheet number to "J101" using the `SheetNumber` property.

10. After setting up the sheet, we commit the changes within the transaction to save them in the document.

11. If everything goes well without any errors, the code returns `Result.Succeeded` to indicate success.

12. However, if an exception occurs during the transaction, the error message is stored in the `message` variable, and the code returns `Result.Failed` to indicate failure.

In summary, this code creates a new sheet in Revit using a specified title block. It collects the appropriate title block symbol from the "OST_TitleBlocks" category, creates a view sheet, and sets its name and sheet number. The code wraps these operations in a transaction to ensure consistent changes in the document.

## Placing Sheets

Sure! Here's an explanation of the code snippet:

1. The code starts by getting the active UI document (`uiDocument`) and the corresponding document (`document`) in Revit.

2. It sets the `TagMode` to `TM_ADDBY_CATEGORY`, indicating that tags will be added based on the category of elements.

3. The `TagOrientation` is set to `Horizontal`, specifying that the tags will be oriented horizontally.

4. A list of `BuiltInCategory` is created to store the categories of elements that we want to tag. In this case, "OST_Windows" and "OST_Doors" are added to the list.

5. An `ElementMulticategoryFilter` is created using the list of categories. This filter will be used to collect the elements in the specified categories.

6. A `FilteredElementCollector` is created, targeting the active view in the document, and it applies the multicategory filter and excludes element types.

7. The `ToElements` method is called to retrieve a list of elements (`tElements`) that pass the applied filters.

8. Now, let's proceed with placing tags on the windows and doors! We start a transaction called "Tagging Windows and Doors" to ensure our changes can be saved together.

9. Within the transaction, a loop is used to iterate through each element in `tElements`.

10. For each element, a `Reference` object is created using the element.

11. The location of the element is retrieved as a `LocationPoint` object, and the `Point` property is accessed to get the XYZ coordinate of the element.

12. The `IndependentTag.Create` method is called to create an independent tag for the element. It takes parameters such as the document, the active view ID, the reference to the element, a boolean value indicating whether the tag is a leader or not, the tag mode, tag orientation, and the location (XYZ) to place the tag.

13. After creating the tag, it is placed on the element within the view.

14. Once all elements have been tagged, the transaction is committed to save the changes in the document.

15. If everything goes well without any errors, the code returns `Result.Succeeded` to indicate success.

16. However, if an exception occurs during the transaction, the error message is stored in the `message` variable, and the code returns `Result.Failed` to indicate failure.

In summary, this code tags windows and doors in the active view of the Revit document. It collects the appropriate elements based on the specified categories, creates independent tags for each element, and places them in the view. The code wraps these operations in a transaction to ensure consistent changes in the document.

```csharp
 UIDocument uiDocument = commandData.Application.ActiveUIDocument;
            Document document = uiDocument.Document;

            ViewSheet sheet = new FilteredElementCollector(document)
                .OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Sheets)
                .Cast<ViewSheet>().First(x => x.Name == "First Sheet");

            Element vPlaim = new FilteredElementCollector(document)
                .OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_Views)
                .First(x => x.Name == "First View");

            BoundingBoxUV outline = sheet.Outline;

            double xu = (outline.Max.U + outline.Min.U) /2;
            double yv = (outline.Max.V + outline.Min.V) /2;

            XYZ midpoint = new XYZ(yv, yv, 0);

            try
            {
                using (Transaction transaction  = new Transaction(document,"Place View"))
                {
                    transaction.Start();

                   Viewport vPort = Viewport.Create(document, sheet.Id,vPlaim.Id,midpoint);

                    transaction.Commit();
                }

                return Result.Succeeded;
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                message = e.Message;
                return Result.Failed;
            }

```

Certainly! Here's an explanation of the code snippet:

1. The code begins by getting the active UI document (`uiDocument`) and the corresponding document (`document`) in Revit.

2. It uses a `FilteredElementCollector` to search for the sheet named "First Sheet" in the document. It filters elements based on the category "OST_Sheets" and casts them as `ViewSheet`. The `First` method is used to retrieve the first sheet that matches the specified condition.

3. Another `FilteredElementCollector` is used to search for the view named "First View" in the document. It filters elements based on the category "OST_Views" and retrieves the first view that matches the specified condition.

4. The `Outline` property of the sheet is accessed to obtain a `BoundingBoxUV` object, which represents a 2D rectangle around the sheet.

5. The `xu` variable is calculated as the average of the maximum and minimum U values of the outline, which represents the X coordinate of the midpoint.

6. Similarly, the `yv` variable is calculated as the average of the maximum and minimum V values of the outline, which represents the Y coordinate of the midpoint.

7. Using the calculated `xu` and `yv` values, a new `XYZ` object named `midpoint` is created with the Z coordinate set to 0.

8. The code starts a new transaction named "Place View" to ensure that the placement of the view on the sheet can be saved as a single operation.

9. Within the transaction, the `Viewport.Create` method is called to create a new `Viewport` object. It takes parameters such as the document, the sheet ID where the view will be placed, the view ID to be shown in the viewport, and the midpoint location (XYZ).

10. After creating the viewport, it is added to the document within the transaction.

11. Once all changes are made, the transaction is committed to save the modifications in the document.

12. If the transaction completes successfully without any exceptions, the code returns `Result.Succeeded` to indicate success.

13. However, if an exception occurs during the transaction, the error message is stored in the `message` variable, and the code returns `Result.Failed` to indicate failure.

In summary, this code places a view ("First View") onto a sheet ("First Sheet") in the Revit document. It retrieves the sheet and view based on their names, calculates the midpoint of the sheet, creates a viewport using the calculated midpoint, and adds the viewport to the document. The code wraps these operations in a transaction to ensure consistent changes in the document.

## External Application Plugins

![[Pasted image 20230708190147.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230708190231.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230708190311.png]]


- In this section, we are introduced to the concept of external applications in Revit, which provide a way to create commands that execute based on events or as part of a custom user interface.

- Similar to creating external commands using the `IExternalCommand` interface, we can also create plugins that implement either the `IExternalApplication` interface or the `IExternalDBApplication` interface.

- The `IExternalApplication` interface allows us to access the Revit user interface and some events through the Revit API. It requires us to override two methods: `OnStartup` and `OnShutdown`, both of which receive a `UIControlledApplication` object as a parameter.

- When a plugin is registered with an `IExternalApplication`, the `OnStartup` method is called when Revit starts up, and Revit passes the `UIControlledApplication` object to the method. Similarly, the `OnShutdown` method is called when Revit shuts down.

- Within the external application plugin, the `UIControlledApplication` object represents the user interface and provides access to methods and events for user interface customization. We can use methods like `CreateRibbonTab`, `CreateRibbonPanel`, or `AddStackedItems` to add external commands to the user interface ribbon. We can also utilize events such as dialog box showing, view activating, or Revit's idling to execute functions when specific events occur in the project.

- If we want to access database-level events, we need to use the `IExternalDBApplication` interface. It is similar to `IExternalApplication`, but it does not provide access to the user interface. It is used to create add-ins that handle events not related to the UI and access database-level events as required.

- Like `IExternalApplication`, a class that inherits from `IExternalDBApplication` needs to implement the `OnStartup` and `OnShutdown` methods. These methods receive a `ControlledApplication` object as a parameter, and the return type is different, accessed from an `ExternalDBApplication` class. The `ControlledApplication` object provides access to database-level events such as document opening, document synchronizing with central, and document saving.

- When creating an `IExternalApplication` or `IExternalDBApplication`, we need to add two different types to the manifest file compared to what we've done for external commands. These types are named differently: the application type for `ExternalApplication` and the DBApplication type for `ExternalDBApplication`. Other tags in the manifest file remain largely the same.

- By utilizing external applications, we can enhance our Revit plugins by responding to events, customizing the user interface, and accessing database-level events for additional functionality.

In summary, this code explains the concept of external applications in Revit, the interfaces used (`IExternalApplication` and `IExternalDBApplication`), and their respective methods (`OnStartup` and `OnShutdown`). It highlights the difference between user interface events and database-level events and demonstrates how to add external commands to the user interface and handle events in the project.

## External Commands Application

Here is a summary of the transcript in understandable bullet points:

- The instructor begins by explaining that they will customize the user interface.
- They mention that selecting transcript lines in this section will navigate to the corresponding timestamp in the video.
- They state that they have implemented the IExternalApplication interface and now want to customize the UI.
- The OnShutdown and OnStartup methods are currently throwing exceptions, so the instructor plans to fix them.
- The OnShutdown method will be called when Revit is shutting down, but since nothing needs to happen in this event, they simply return a successful result.
- The OnStartup method is where they can create a new ribbon element, so they remove the exception and add the new ribbon element.
- They access the UIControlledApplication object to add a new tab using the CreateRibbonTab method, giving it a name (e.g., "My Commands").
- To make the UI more exciting, they decide to add a button.
- They create a PushButtonData object using the PushButtonData class and assign it a name, visible name, assembly (the .dll file), and class name for the button command.
- The button can be connected to external commands they have created, and it will be placed within the new tab.
- They create a button that will execute the PlaceFamily command they previously created.
- They access the executing assembly using the GetExecutingAssembly method from the System.Reflection namespace.
- They use the assembly's file path and the full class name for the executing command in the PushButtonData constructor.
- Next, they create a panel to group commands within the tab using the CreateRibbonPanel method.
- They add the button to the panel using the AddItem method.
- They return a successful result from the method.
- They mention that the necessary code is already written into the manifest file and suggest trying the new tab.
- They explain that the new tab and the PlaceFamily command are now visible in Revit.
- They go to the Ground Floor plan and try the command, confirming that the button executes the previously created command.
- They note that adding commands to buttons is a cleaner way of grouping custom commands and executing them.
- They explain that referencing the command via the application eliminates the need to add it as a command to the manifest file, simplifying the process.


```csharp
 public class ExternalApplication :IExternalApplication
    {
        public Result OnStartup(UIControlledApplication application)
        {
            application.CreateRibbonTab("Personal Commands");

            string path = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location;
            PushButtonData button = new PushButtonData("Button1", "PlaceFamily", path, "MyRevitTraining.PlaceFamily");

            RibbonPanel panel = application.CreateRibbonPanel("Personal Commands", "Commands");


            panel.AddItem(button);

            return Result.Succeeded;
        }

        public Result OnShutdown(UIControlledApplication application)
        {
            return Result.Succeeded;
        }
    }
```
Code explanation
Certainly! Here's the explanation for the provided code:

- The code defines a class called `ExternalApplication` that implements the `IExternalApplication` interface. This allows the customization of the Revit user interface.
- The `OnStartup` method is overridden from the interface and is called when Revit starts up. It receives a `UIControlledApplication` object as a parameter, which represents the Revit user interface.
- Inside the `OnStartup` method, a new ribbon tab is created using the `CreateRibbonTab` method on the `UIControlledApplication` object. The tab is named "Personal Commands".
- The `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location` method is used to retrieve the location (path) of the executing assembly. This is stored in the `path` variable.
- A new `PushButtonData` object is created, specifying the button name ("Button1"), visible name ("PlaceFamily"), assembly path (`path` variable), and the class name for the button command ("MyRevitTraining.PlaceFamily").
- A `RibbonPanel` object is created using the `CreateRibbonPanel` method on the `UIControlledApplication` object. The panel is added to the "Personal Commands" tab and named "Commands".
- The button is added to the panel using the `AddItem` method on the `RibbonPanel` object, passing the `button` object as a parameter.
- The `OnStartup` method returns `Result.Succeeded`.
- The `OnShutdown` method is also overridden from the interface, and it simply returns `Result.Succeeded`.
- When the code is executed, the "Personal Commands" tab will appear in the Revit user interface. Inside that tab, a panel named "Commands" will contain a button labeled "PlaceFamily". Clicking the button will execute the specified command.
- This approach allows for the customization of the Revit UI by creating a new tab, adding a button to a panel, and associating the button with a specific command. The `OnStartup` and `OnShutdown` methods provide control over the behavior of the application during startup and shutdown.

In summary, this code demonstrates how to create a custom tab, panel, and button in the Revit user interface using the `IExternalApplication` interface. It shows how to specify the command to be executed when the button is clicked and provides flexibility in organizing and executing custom commands within Revit.

## Adding Icons to the button

![[Pasted image 20230708193946.png]]

- Go to assembly
- Search "Presentation core"
- Press "OK"

- Adding images to buttons in the Revit user interface (UI) enhances visual appeal and usability.
- It is recommended to use 32x32 pixel images for buttons and 16x16 pixel images for smaller controls like drop-downs.
- In the provided code example, the instructor demonstrates how to add an image to a button in an external application.
- The instructor suggests creating larger images and scaling them down if desired.
- The code includes creating a new tab and button within the external application.
- The button properties are accessed by creating a variable of type PushButton.
- The System.Windows.Media assembly is referenced to load the image as a URI.
- A BitmapImage variable is created and assigned the image path as a parameter.
- The image variable is assigned to the large image property of the button.
- By executing the code and opening the Revit exercise file, the custom icon is displayed on the button in the new tab.
- Adding icons to buttons enhances the display of commands in the UI, making it more engaging and dynamic.
- Developers can refer to the Revit Developer Guideline pages for more information on button types and design guidelines.

```csharp

Code Explanation:
Certainly! Here's the explanation for the provided code:

- The code starts by creating a new ribbon tab using the `CreateRibbonTab` method on the `UIControlledApplication` object. The tab is named "Personal Commands".
- The `Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location` method is used to retrieve the location (path) of the executing assembly. This is stored in the `path` variable.
- A new `PushButtonData` object is created, specifying the button name ("Button1"), visible name ("PlaceFamily"), assembly path (`path` variable), and the class name for the button command ("MyRevitTraining.PlaceFamily").
- A `RibbonPanel` object is created using the `CreateRibbonPanel` method on the `UIControlledApplication` object. The panel is added to the "Personal Commands" tab and named "Commands".
- Next, an `Uri` object is created, specifying the path to an image file (e.g., "D:\JP\MyRevitTraining\Images\icons\Desk.png").
- A `BitmapImage` object is created using the `Uri` object, loading the image from the specified file.
- The `AddItem` method is called on the `RibbonPanel` object, passing the `button` object as a parameter. The return value is cast to a `PushButton` object and stored in the `pushButton` variable.
- The `LargeImage` property of the `pushButton` is set to the `image`, which assigns the specified image as the large icon for the button.
- Finally, the `OnStartup` method returns `Result.Succeeded`.

When this code is executed, it creates a custom tab named "Personal Commands" in the Revit user interface. Inside that tab, a panel named "Commands" is added. A button labeled "PlaceFamily" is added to the panel. The button is associated with the specified command. Additionally, a large image is assigned to the button using the specified image file.

This approach allows for the customization of the Revit UI by creating a new tab, panel, and button. The code demonstrates how to specify an image for the button, providing a visual representation for the command.

## Adding Icons to the button

![[Pasted image 20230708193946.png]]

- Go to assembly
- Search "Presentation core"
- Press "OK"

- Adding images to buttons in the Revit user interface (UI) enhances visual appeal and usability.
- It is recommended to use 32x32 pixel images for buttons and 16x16 pixel images for smaller controls like drop-downs.
- In the provided code example, the instructor demonstrates how to add an image to a button in an external application.
- The instructor suggests creating larger images and scaling them down if desired.
- The code includes creating a new tab and button within the external application.
- The button properties are accessed by creating a variable of type PushButton.
- The System.Windows.Media assembly is referenced to load the image as a URI.
- A BitmapImage variable is created and assigned the image path as a parameter.
- The image variable is assigned to the large image property of the button.
- By executing the code and opening the Revit exercise file, the custom icon is displayed on the button in the new tab.
- Adding icons to buttons enhances the display of commands in the UI, making it more engaging and dynamic.
- Developers can refer to the Revit Developer Guideline pages for more information on button types and design guidelines.

```csharp
 application.CreateRibbonTab("Personal Commands");

            string path = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location;
            PushButtonData button = new PushButtonData("Button1", "PlaceFamily", path, "MyRevitTraining.PlaceFamily");

            RibbonPanel panel = application.CreateRibbonPanel("Personal Commands", "Commands");

            Uri imagePath = new Uri(@"D:\JP\MyRevitTraining\Images\icons\Desk.png");

            BitmapImage image = new BitmapImage(imagePath);

            PushButton pushButton =    panel.AddItem(button) as PushButton;

            pushButton.LargeImage = image;

            return Result.Succeeded;
```
